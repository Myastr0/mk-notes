- You can sync to **Notion Pages** or **Notion Databases** for flexible content management.
- You can use it to share your technical documentation inside your Notion workspace.
- You can publish your documentation to the web using Notion Publish.
- It enables you to use the Notion AI to find info in your technical documentation.
- You can automate synchronization with GitHub Actions for continuous documentation updates.

💅 Based on [GitHub Flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specification.
