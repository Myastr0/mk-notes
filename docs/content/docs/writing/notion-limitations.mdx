This document outlines the known and undocumented limitations and constraints when using Notion API with `mk-notes`. Understanding these limitations will help you structure your markdown content appropriately.

---

## List Nesting Limitations

### Bulleted and Numbered Lists

Notion API has a **maximum nesting depth of 3 levels** for bulleted and numbered lists. Attempting to create lists with more than 2 levels of nesting will result in a validation error.

#### What happens when you exceed the limit?

When you try to sync markdown content with more than 3 levels of list nesting, you'll encounter a validation error like this:

```
APIResponseError: body failed validation: body.children[0].bulleted_list_item.children[0].bulleted_list_item.children[0].bulleted_list_item.children should be not present
```

#### Example of problematic structure

```markdown
- Level 1
  - Level 2
    - Level 3
      - Level 4 (‚ùå This will cause an error)
```

#### Supported structure

```markdown
- Level 1
  - Level 2
    - Level 3 (‚úÖ Maximum supported depth)
```

### Workarounds

If you need to represent deeper hierarchical content, consider these alternatives:

1. **Use headings instead of nested lists**

   ```markdown
   ## Level 1

   ### Level 2

   #### Level 3

   ##### Level 4 (‚ùå This will cause an error)
   ```

2. **Convert deep nesting to paragraphs**

   ```markdown
   - Level 1
     - Level 2
       - Level 3

   Additional content as paragraph text instead of Level 4 list item.
   ```

3. **Use callouts or toggles for complex hierarchies**

   ```markdown
   - Level 1
     - Level 2

   > **Note**: Additional details can be placed in callouts
   ```

## Icon Limitations

### Custom Images Not Supported

The Notion API currently does not support custom image uploads for page icons. Only general emojis are available.

```markdown
---
icon: üí°  ‚úÖ Supported
icon: üöÄ  ‚úÖ Supported
icon: custom-image.png  ‚ùå Not supported
---
```

---

## Other Known Limitations

### File Upload Constraints

- Maximum file size limits apply for image uploads
- Only specific image formats are supported (`.bmp`, `.gif`, `.heic`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, `.tif`, `.tiff`)

### Rich Text Limitations

- Text content is limited to 2000 characters per rich text block
- Complex formatting combinations may not be fully supported

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep list nesting to 2 levels maximum**
2. **Use headings for deeper hierarchies**
3. **Test your content structure before bulk synchronization**
4. **Use callouts and toggles for complex content organization**

These limitations are based on the current Notion API capabilities. As Notion updates their API, some of these constraints may be lifted. Check the official [Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/) for the latest updates.
