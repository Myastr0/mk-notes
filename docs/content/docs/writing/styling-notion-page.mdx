This document explains how to customize your Notion Page directly from your markdown files

---

## Introduction

Mk Notes relies on `frontmatter` to be able to add metadata on markdown files.

```markdown
# Beginning of your markdown file

---

id: unique-page-identifier
title: The notion page title
icon: 💡

---
```

## Compatible properties

Here's the Mk Notes supported properties to customize your Notion Page

### `id`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property stores the Notion page ID that was created during synchronization. When you use the `--save-id` option, MK Notes automatically writes the Notion page ID back to your markdown file's frontmatter.

On subsequent syncs, MK Notes uses this `id` to update the existing Notion page instead of creating a new one. This enables **incremental updates** and prevents duplicate pages.

```markdown
id: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
```

<Callout type="info" title="Automatically generated">

You don't need to set this property manually. Use the `--save-id` flag when running the sync command, and MK Notes will automatically populate this field with the Notion page ID after synchronization.

</Callout>

### `title`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property allows you to specify a Notion page title.
If you do not provide this property, Mk Notes will rely on the name of the file.

```markdown
title: <string>
```

### `icon`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property allows you to set an icon to your Notion Page.

```markdown
icon: <emoji-unicode>
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Icon limitation">

Unfortunately, at the moment, Notion API does not support custom image upload. Only general emojis are available.

</Callout>
