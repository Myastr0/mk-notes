This document explains how to customize your Notion Page directly from your markdown files

---

## Introduction

Mk Notes relies on `frontmatter` to be able to add metadata on markdown files.

```markdown
# Beginning of your markdown file

---

id: unique-page-identifier
title: The notion page title
icon: 💡

---
```

## Compatible properties

Here's the Mk Notes supported properties to customize your Notion Page

### `id`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property allows you to specify a unique identifier for your page. This is particularly useful when syncing to a **Notion Database** with the `--clean` option enabled.

When clean sync is enabled and the destination is a database, Mk Notes will use this `id` to find and delete existing pages with the same identifier before creating a new one. This ensures that repeated syncs don't create duplicate entries.

```markdown
id: <unique-identifier>
```

<Callout type="info" title="Database property">

When syncing to a database, the `id` value is stored in a property named `mk-notes-id` in your Notion database.

</Callout>

### `title`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property allows you to specify a Notion page title.
If you do not provide this property, Mk Notes will rely on the name of the file.

```markdown
title: <string>
```

### `icon`

- Type: `string`

_optional_

This property allows you to set an icon to your Notion Page.

```markdown
icon: <emoji-unicode>
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Icon limitation">

Unfortunately, at the moment, Notion API does not support custom image upload. Only general emojis are available.

</Callout>
