description: Use Mk Notes with GitHub Actions to automate markdown to Notion synchronization
---

Mk Notes provides GitHub Actions that allow you to automate the synchronization of your markdown files to Notion directly from your GitHub workflows. This is perfect for automatically updating your Notion documentation whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Available Actions

Mk Notes offers two GitHub Actions:

- [`Myastr0/mk-notes/preview`](./available-actions/1-preview-action.mdx) - Previews the synchronization result without actually syncing
- [`Myastr0/mk-notes/sync`](./available-actions/2-sync-action.mdx) - Synchronizes markdown files or directories to a Notion page

---

## Getting started

You can find a tutorial to get started with GitHub Actions in the [Your first synchronization](/docs/github-actions/first-synchronization/) guide.
