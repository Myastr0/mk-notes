description: Use Mk Notes with GitHub Actions to automate markdown to Notion synchronization
---

Mk Notes provides GitHub Actions that allow you to automate the synchronization of your markdown files to Notion directly from your GitHub workflows. This is perfect for automatically updating your Notion documentation whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Available Actions

Mk Notes offers two GitHub Actions:

- **`sync`** - Synchronizes markdown files or directories to a Notion page
- **`preview`** - Previews the synchronization result without actually syncing

## Quick Start

1. [Set up your secrets](./setup.mdx) in your GitHub repository

   - Use the [sync action](./available-actions/2-sync-action.mdx) to automatically update your Notion pages
   - Use the [preview action](./available-actions/1-preview-action.mdx) to test changes before syncing
3. Follow the [best practices](./best-practices.mdx) for optimal results
