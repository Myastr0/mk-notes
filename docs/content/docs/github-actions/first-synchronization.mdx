title: Your first synchronization
description: Tutorial to make your first synchronization with Mk Notes using GitHub Actions
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up automated synchronization of your markdown files to a Notion page using Mk Notes GitHub Actions.

---

## Requirements

- A **Notion Integration** with read-write access on your Notion page
  <Callout>
    Read the official [Notion
    guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization) to create and setup
    a Notion Integration on your workspace
  </Callout>
- A **GitHub repository** with your markdown files

## Step-by-step guide ðŸ‘‡

### Step 1: Preview the synchronization result

Before setting up the automated synchronization, you can preview the result by using the preview action in a GitHub workflow:

```yaml
name: Preview Sync

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Preview synchronization
        uses: Myastr0/mk-notes/preview
        with:
          input: './docs' # Path to your markdown files
          format: 'plainText'
```

This will show you the Notion page architecture that will be generated based on your markdown files.

### Step 2: Set up automated synchronization

Create a GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows/sync-to-notion.yml`) to automate the synchronization:

```yaml
name: Sync to Notion

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['docs/**'] # Only trigger when docs change

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Sync to Notion
        uses: Myastr0/mk-notes/sync
        with:
          input: './docs' # Path to your markdown files
          destination: <your-notion-page-url>
          notion-api-key: ${{ secrets.NOTION_API_KEY }}
```

---

This workflow will automatically synchronize your markdown files to Notion whenever you push changes to the `docs/` directory on the main branch.

<Callout type="info">
  `NOTION_API_KEY` can be found in your Notion Integration settings.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that you can only synchronize markdown files to **Notion Pages**.
  Notion Databases are not supported for now.
</Callout>

## Going further

Mk Notes allows you to style the created Notion pages directly from your markdown. You can find more information in the [Styling Notion Page](/docs/writing/styling-notion-page/) guide.

You can also explore more advanced workflows in the [Best Practices](../best-practices.mdx) guide.
