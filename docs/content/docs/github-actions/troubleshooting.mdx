description: Common issues and solutions when using Mk Notes GitHub Actions
---

## Common Issues

### 1. Permission Denied

**Problem**: The action fails with permission errors.

**Solutions**:

- Make sure your Notion integration has access to the target page
- Check that the integration is added to the correct workspace
- Verify the page URL is correct and accessible

### 2. Invalid API Key

**Problem**: Authentication fails with invalid API key errors.

**Solutions**:

- Verify your `NOTION_API_KEY` secret is correct
- Check for extra spaces or characters in the secret value
- Ensure the API key hasn't expired
- Test the API key locally using the CLI

### 3. Page Not Found

**Problem**: The action can't find the specified Notion page.

**Solutions**:

- Check that your `NOTION_DOCS_PAGE_URL` is valid and accessible
- Ensure the page hasn't been deleted or moved
- Verify the integration has access to the page
- Test the page URL in your browser

### 4. Build Failures

**Problem**: The workflow fails during the build process.

**Solutions**:

- Ensure your repository has the necessary files and structure
- Check that the `input` path exists and contains valid markdown files
- Verify file permissions and repository structure
- Test the sync locally first

### 5. Clean Sync Issues

**Problem**: Clean sync removes more content than expected.

**Solutions**:

- Use clean sync only on dedicated pages
- Always backup important content before using clean sync
- Test with preview first to understand what will be removed
- Consider using incremental sync instead

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Logs

Always start by examining the detailed logs in your GitHub Actions run:

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Expand the step that failed
4. Look for specific error messages

### 2. Verify Secrets

Double-check your repository secrets:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Verify secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Check that secret values don't have extra spaces
4. Test secrets locally if possible

### 3. Test Locally First

Use the Mk Notes CLI to test your configuration:

```bash
# Test with preview
npx mk-notes preview ./docs --format plainText

# Test with sync (be careful!)
npx mk-notes sync ./docs --destination "your-page-url" --api-key "your-key"
```

### 4. Use Preview Action

Always use the preview action to verify structure before syncing:

```yaml
- name: Preview synchronization
  uses: Myastr0/mk-notes/preview@v1
  with:
    input: './docs'
    format: 'plainText'
    output: './preview.txt'

- name: Upload preview for review
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: sync-preview
    path: ./preview.txt
```

### 5. Check Notion Integration

Verify your Notion integration setup:

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Check that your integration is active
3. Verify it has access to the correct workspace
4. Ensure the target page is shared with the integration

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the documentation**: Review the [CLI Commands](/docs/cli/guides/cli-commands) documentation
2. **Search existing issues**: Look through our [GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/Myastr0/mk-notes/issues)
3. **Create a new issue**: If you can't find a solution, create a new issue with:
   - Detailed error messages
   - Your workflow configuration
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any relevant logs (remove sensitive information)

## Prevention Tips

- Always test workflows in a development environment first
- Use preview actions before syncing
- Keep backups of important Notion content
- Monitor workflow runs regularly
- Use conditional logic to prevent accidental syncs
- Document your workflow configurations
