description: Learn how to configure the required secrets for GitHub Actions
---

To use the GitHub Actions, you'll need to set up the following secrets in your repository:

1. **`NOTION_API_KEY`** - Your Notion integration secret token
2. **`NOTION_DOCS_PAGE_URL`** - The URL of the Notion page where you want to sync your documentation

## How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add each secret with the appropriate value

## Getting Your Notion API Key

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **New integration**
3. Give it a name and select the workspace
4. Copy the **Internal Integration Token**
5. Add it as `NOTION_API_KEY` in your GitHub secrets

## Getting Your Notion Page URL

1. Open the Notion page where you want to sync your documentation
2. Click **Share** → **Copy link**
3. Copy the URL and add it as `NOTION_DOCS_PAGE_URL` in your GitHub secrets

## Page Permissions

After creating your integration, you need to give it access to your Notion pages:

1. Open the Notion page where you want to sync content
2. Click **Share** in the top-right corner
3. Click **Add people, emails, groups, or integrations**
4. Search for your integration name and add it
5. Choose the appropriate permission level (usually "Can edit")

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets to your repository
- Use repository secrets for sensitive information
- Regularly rotate your Notion API keys
- Use different integrations for different environments when possible
- Monitor your integration usage in Notion

## Troubleshooting Secrets

If you're having issues with secrets:

1. **Verify secret names**: Make sure the secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. **Check secret values**: Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
3. **Test locally**: Use the CLI to test your credentials before setting up GitHub Actions
4. **Check permissions**: Verify your Notion integration has access to the target page
