### Step 1: Preview the synchronization result

Before starting the synchronization, you can preview the result of the synchronization by running the following command:

```bash
  mk-notes preview-sync --input <path-to-your-markdown-file-or-directory>
```

You will see the Notion page architecture that will be generated based on your markdown files.

### Step 2: Synchronize your markdown files

Launch the following command:

```bash
  mk-notes sync \
    --input <path-to-your-markdown-file-or-directory> \
    --destination <notion-page-url> \
    --notion-api-key <your-notion-secret>
```

- `--input` : The path to your markdown file or directory containing markdown files.
- `--destination` : The Notion page URL where you want to synchronize your markdown files.
- `--notion-api-key` : Your Notion secret token.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that you can only synchronize markdown files to **Notion Pages**.
  Notion Databases are not supported for now.
