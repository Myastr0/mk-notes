We're thrilled to announce **Mk Notes v3.0.0** – a major release that brings one of our most requested features: **Notion database synchronization**! 🗄️

Until now, Mk Notes could sync your markdown files to Notion pages, mirroring your folder structure. With v3.0.0, you can now sync directly to **Notion databases**, unlocking powerful organizational features like filtering, sorting, and custom views.

## Why Database Sync?

Notion databases are incredibly powerful for managing collections of documents. By syncing your markdown content to a database, you can:

- **Organize with views**: Table, board, gallery, or calendar – pick your favorite way to browse your docs
- **Filter & sort**: Quickly find content using Notion's native filtering system
- **Add custom metadata**: Enrich your pages with properties like status, tags, categories, or dates
- **Scale effortlessly**: Perfect for managing large documentation sets, knowledge bases, or content libraries

## How It Works

Getting started with database sync is simple. Just point your `--destination` flag to a Notion database URL instead of a page:

```bash
mk-notes sync \
  --input ./docs \
  --destination https://notion.so/myworkspace/my-database-123456 \
  --notion-api-key secret_abc123...
```

Mk Notes automatically detects whether your destination is a page or a database and handles the sync accordingly.

## Custom Properties from Frontmatter

One of the most exciting features is the ability to populate database properties directly from your markdown frontmatter. Add a `properties` field to your frontmatter, and Mk Notes will map the values to your Notion database columns:

```markdown
---
id: getting-started-guide
title: Getting Started
properties:
  - name: status
    value: published
  - name: category
    value: Documentation
  - name: priority
    value: high
---

Your content here...
```

Mk Notes supports a wide range of property types including text, numbers, select, multi-select, checkboxes, URLs, emails, dates, and more!

## Clean Sync for Databases

We've also introduced a clean sync mode for databases. By adding a `mk-notes-id` text property to your database and using the `--clean` flag, Mk Notes can identify and update existing pages instead of creating duplicates:

```bash
    mk-notes sync \
        --input ./docs \
        --destination <database-url> \
        --notion-api-key <api-key> \
        --clean
```

Combined with the `id` frontmatter property in your markdown files, this enables a true **idempotent sync** workflow – run it as many times as you want, and your database stays clean.

## Real-World Use Cases

Here are some ways you can leverage database sync:

- **Documentation portals**: Sync your docs and use a board view to track review status
- **Blog management**: Manage draft and published posts with a table view
- **Knowledge bases**: Organize articles by category with a gallery view
- **Release notes**: Track versions with dates using a timeline view

## Getting Started
