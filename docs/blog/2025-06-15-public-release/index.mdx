We are thrilled to announce that **Mk Notes** is now live on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/mk-notes)! ðŸš€

**Mk Notes** makes it effortless to migrate and sync your Markdown documentation to Notion. Whether you're an individual or a team, Mk Notes lets you keep your documentation workflowâ€”write in Markdown, version with Git, and sync everything to Notion with a single command.

### Why Mk Notes?

The motivation behind Mk Notes is to ease the migration from simple markdown docs to Notion. We love the simplicity and flexibility of Markdown, but also want to leverage Notion's collaboration and publishing features. Mk Notes bridges that gapâ€”no more manual copy-paste, just seamless sync.

### What can you do with Mk Notes?

- Sync Markdown files or entire directories to Notion
- Mirror your folder structure as Notion pages
- Preview Notion structure before syncing
- Use Notion AI on your synced docs
- Publish docs to the web via Notion Publish
